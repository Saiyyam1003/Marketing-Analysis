# Marketing-Analysis
Project created by SAIYYAM LODAYA.
IN this project, we analyse and perform EDA on a sales dataset. We preprocess the data and do feature engineering on the data to find the most relevant features.
We then perform customer segmentation using clustering to identify different groups of people who respond to the marketing campaigns.
